    <h2>Persona:</h2>
    <div class="persona-container">
        <p><strong>Name:</strong> Julie S. Tillerman</p>
        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 25</p>
        <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Graphic Designer</p>
    </div>
    <div class="persona-attrib">
        <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Julie is a Senior Graphic Designer for a start-up tech company. She takes pride in
            the precision, flow, and layout of her work. She was recently diagnosed with an autoimmune condition, and
            often becomes disheartened about her career as she navigates the real struggles of her condition.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="persona-attrib">
        <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Julie utilizes a lower-end MacBook Pro along with a logitech mouse, a decent sized
            Wacom tablet, and an OLED external monitor. This is often all connected using a laptop docking station that Julie does
            not know the name of. They use their computer for business and personal activities. They use a standard iPhone 14
            for everyday use.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="persona-attrib">
        <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Having been recently diagnosed with a chronic health condition, Julie
            often times struggles with trying to get through the day without her condition interfering. She loves design and
            inspirational messages, especially if it is something she can directly identify with. She often times loses
            motivation because she feels like she's struggling with managing a career and a condition all on her own.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="persona-attrib">
        <p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Julie is feeling stressed out from work, and her friends do not fully
            understand the things she struggles with. This struggle causes her to feel unsupported, unmotivated, and often
            times lost in feeling like nobody understands her. Her immediate support group only can do so much to show
            her support.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="persona-attrib">
        <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Julie is a curious individual who stumbles upon life-stories. She likes to find online
            content by word-of-mouth, and she wants to find someone she can identify with. Having someone voice their struggles with career/health in a very identifiable
            way, with quality resources, will help me to feel supported and inspired to move forward in life.</p>
